# for score makers and score players

## 15 November 2025 4pm - 6pm @ [Pony Books](https://www.instagram.com/pony_books_gbg/?hl=en), Tunnbindaregatan 19, Gothenburg Sweden

Are you a musician, visual artist, instrumentalist, composer, performer, designer, sound artist, textile artist, octopus, improvisor or photographer? If so, your future may hold a Graphic Score Laboratory workshop...

Graphic Score Laboratory is a cross-disciplinary workshop for people who play music (*score players*) and people who work with visual media (*score makers*). Score makers bring selected visual media to display in the space for score players to interpret as graphic musical scores. Through this format, Graphic Score Laboratory functions as a meeting space for artists and musicians.

The inaugural Graphic Score Laboratory workshop on 15.11.2025 will be facilitated by [Rachel Barron](https://www.rachel-barron.com/) and [Lucy Strauss](https://lucystrauss.com/). This event is part of [a full day of activities](https://www.artka.se/events/solidarity-ecologies) by the Pony Books Artist Network for the G√∂teborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art [(GIBCA) Extended](https://www.gibca.se/en/gibca-extended/programme/) program.

# `"FAQ"`

### `"wow! this sounds incredible! i'm in! how do i sign up?"`

Sign up by filling out this short form. Spaces are limited.

### `"what is a graphic score?"`

A musical *score* is the written, printed form of a musical composition. We can think of a score as a prompt, or a set of instructions for playing music. Instead of traditional music notation of notes ùÑû‚ô´ and chords, *graphic* scores indicate musical ideas with visual elements such as lines, shapes, dots, images, etc. ‚ñÅ‚ñÇ‚ñÉ‚ñÑ‚ñÖ‚ñÜ‚ñá‚ñà‚ñê‚ñï ‚ñî‚ñÄ ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñó‚ññ‚ñù‚ñò‚ñô‚ñü ‚ñõ‚ñú ‚ñö‚ñû ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë

Graphic Score Laboratory takes the above definition as a starting point for a broad and inclusive understanding of what a graphic score could be. In this space, we consider visual media as scores even if they were not intended as scores originally...

Have you ever looked at a beaded tapestry and wondered what it would sound like if it was interpreted as a set of instructions for playing music? Of course you have!

### `"i still don't know what a graphic score is... can i still attend?"`

Yes! We will not throw you into the deep-end (unless you are an octopus). The workshop will begin with a short introduction to graphic scores. After that, we will get used to playing and making graphic scores together through guided exercises.

### `"how is this different from a jam session?"`

Graphic Score Laboratory follows a structured workshop format where the facilitators guide participants through listening exercises, improvisation games, drawing exercises, etc.

### `"what can i hope to gain by taking part?"`

Graphic Score Laboratory is experimental both in its content and concept, so expect the unexpected! That being said, we hope you will leave the workshop with a refreshed feeling of inspiration; a new set of skills in playing, making and listening; and maybe even some new friends and foes.

### `"am i a score-maker?"`

Anyone who has a practice working with visual media can sign up to attend a Graphic Score Laboratory workshop as a score maker. Whether your medium is painting, drawing, photography, filmmaking, printmaking, textiles, graphic design, graffiti, sculpting, ceramics... you get the idea. You can also join if you are a composer of music!

### `"am i a score-player?"`

You can join as a score player if you have a practice that involves playing music or sound. Whether you play drums, violin, oud, eurorack, mbira, voice, guitar, lute, trombone... you are welcome in this space. Likewise, you do not need to know how to read music and you do not need to have experience improvising. This workshop is designed to be accessible and enriching for a diversity of score players.

### `"can i join if i am self-taught?"`

Yes! There is no expectation of any formal training or qualifications in art or music. The important thing is that you have a practice that you can bring into the space to either make or play graphic scores.

### `"i already know everything about graphic scores. should i still attend?"`

The purpose of this workshop is not only to learn about graphic scores. Even if you are already a graphic score expert, you can still learn a lot through the practices and perspectives of everyone in the room. Besides, we are actually launching Graphic Score Laboratory as an excuse to play music an doodle together, while networking with people across disciplines. If that isn't enough to convince you, maybe this will: Pony Books sells books and coffee. We will see you there.

### `"can i attend as a score maker and a score player?"`

This option is only possible if you are an octopus. During the workshop, players and makers will do different exercises in the space at the same time, so you might find it tricky to multi-task, unless you have eight tentacles. Get in touch if you would like to attend, but still can't decide.

### `"what do i need to bring?"`

Score makers should bring some visual media to display (eg. a painting; a drawing; a scanned print of your original artwork; a photograph; a laptop to display a digital artwork, etc). We will provide basic materials for sketching / drawing, but please also bring any specific materials you would like to work with during the workshop.

Score players should bring their instruments, including everything they need to make a sound (amps, audio interfaces, etc.)

### `"if i am not a score maker or player, can i attend as an audience member?"`

Given that space in the venue is limited, preference will be given to score makers and players to sign up for spots at the workshop. We will release a limited number of audience tickets a week before the event. Fill out this short form if you would like to be notified when audience tickets become available.

### `"why is there so much mention of octopuses in this FAQ?"`

This FAQ was written by someone who has spent too much time playing improvised music. They can no longer resist playing with the emergent themes and melodies of life. This side effect is fortunately irreversible.
