# concept

Graphic Score Laboratory is a cross-disciplinary workshop for people who play music (*score players*) and people who work with visual media (*score makers*).

Score makers bring selected visual media to display in the space for score players to interpret as graphic musical scores.


# FAQ

## `"i don't know what a graphic score is... can i still attend?"`

Yes! We will not throw you into the deep-end (unless you are an octopus). The workshop will begin with a short presentation introducing graphic scores. After that, we will get used to playing and making graphic scores together through exercises guided by the workshop leaders.

## `"am i a score-maker?"`

Anyone who has a practice working with visual media can sign up to attend a Graphic Score Laboratory workshop as a score maker. Whether your medium is painting, drawing, photography, filmmaking, printmaking, textiles, graphic design, graffiti, sculpting, ceramics... you get the idea. You can also join if you are a composer of music!

## `"am i a score-player?"`

You can join as a score player if you have a practice that involves playing music or sound. Whether you play drums, violin, oud, eurorack, mbira, guitar, lute, trombone... you are welcome in this space.

## `"can i join if i am self-taught?"`

Yes! There is no expectation of any formal training or qualifications in art or music. The important thing is that you have a practice that you can bring into the space to either make or play graphic scores.

## `"can i attend as a score maker and a score player?"`

This option is only possible if you are an octopus. During the workshop, players and makers will do separate exercises in the space at the same time, so you might find it tricky to multi-task.
