Graphic Score Laboratory is a cross-disciplinary workshop for people who play music (*score players*) and people who work with visual media (*score makers*).

Score makers bring selected visual media to display in the space for score players to interpret as graphic musical scores.


# FAQ

## `"am i a score-maker?"`

Anyone who has a practice working with visual media can sign up to attend a Graphic Score Laboratory workshop as a score maker. Whether your medium is painting, drawing, photography, filmmaking, printmaking, textiles, graphic design, graffiti, sculpting, ceramics... you get the idea. You can also join if you are a composer of music!

## `"am i a score-player?"`

You can join as a score player if you have a practice that involves playing music or sound. 

## `"can i join if i am self-taught?"`

Yes! There is no expectation of any formal qualifications in art or music. The important thing is that you have a practice that you can bring into the space to either make or play graphic scores.

## `"can i attend as a score maker and a score player?"`

This option is only possible if you are an octopus. During the workshop, players and makers will do separate exercises in the space at the same time, so you might find it tricky to multi-task.
