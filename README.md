Graphic Score Laboratory is a cross-disciplinary workshop for people who play music (*score players*) and people who work with visual media (*score makers*). Score makers bring selected visual media to display in the space for score players to interpret as graphic musical scores.

# FAQ

## `"wow! this sounds incredible! i'm in! how do i sign up?"`

Sign up by filling out this short form. Spaces are limited.

## `"i don't know what a graphic score is... can i still attend?"`

Yes! We will not throw you into the deep-end (unless you are an octopus). The workshop will begin with a short presentation introducing graphic scores. After that, we will get used to playing and making graphic scores together through exercises guided by the workshop leaders.

## `"how is this different from a jam session?"`

Graphic Score Laboratory follows a structured workshop format where the facilitators guide participants through listening exercises, improvisation games, drawing exercises, etc.

## `"what can i hope to gain by taking part?"`

Graphic Score Laboratory is experimental both in its content and concept. That being said, we hope you will leave the workshop with a refreshed feeling of inspiration; a new set of skills in playing, making and listening; and maybe even some new friends and foes.

## `"am i a score-maker?"`

Anyone who has a practice working with visual media can sign up to attend a Graphic Score Laboratory workshop as a score maker. Whether your medium is painting, drawing, photography, filmmaking, printmaking, textiles, graphic design, graffiti, sculpting, ceramics... you get the idea. You can also join if you are a composer of music!

## `"am i a score-player?"`

You can join as a score player if you have a practice that involves playing music or sound. Whether you play drums, violin, oud, eurorack, mbira, voice, guitar, lute, trombone... you are welcome in this space. Likewise, you do not need to know how to read music and you do not need to have experience improvising. This workshop is designed to be accessible and enriching for a diversity of score players.

## `"can i join if i am self-taught?"`

Yes! There is no expectation of any formal training or qualifications in art or music. The important thing is that you have a practice that you can bring into the space to either make or play graphic scores.

## `"can i attend as a score maker and a score player?"`

This option is only possible if you are an octopus. During the workshop, players and makers will do separate exercises in the space at the same time, so you might find it tricky to multi-task, unless you have eight tentacles.
